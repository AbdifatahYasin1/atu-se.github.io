## Topics Covered

* The midterm exam will cover the following sections:
  - Context-Free Grammars (2.1)
  - Pushdown Automata (2.2)
  - Non-Context Free Languages (2.3)
  - Turing Machines (3.1)
  - Variants of Turing Machines (3.2)
  - The Definition of Algorithm (3.3)
  - Previously material, while not necessarily directly addressed on the exam


## Topics Not on Exam

- Deterministic Context-Free Languages (2.4) will not be covered on the exam

## Outline of Notable Topics

- Context-Free Grammars (2.1)
  - Given an example of a context-free grammar, be prepared to:
    - Explain its parts
    - Create a parse tree
    - Create a left- or right-hand derivation
- Pushdown Automata (2.2)
  - Be able to identify a pushdown automata by its schematic or state diagram
  - Be prepared to identify strings in a language given its PDA
- Non-Context Free Languages (2.3)
  - Understand the purpose of the Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages
  - Understand the general strategy for applying the PL for Context-Free Languages
- Turing Machines (3.1)
    - Be able to identify a Turing Machine by its schematic or state diagram
    - Be able to compare and contrast a Turing machine with other types of machines
    - Be able to provide the implementation of a Turing machine
    - You are not required to design a state diagram; you should be able to design an algorithm which explains how the tape head will move back and forth and mark in order to execute your design
    - Understand the difference between a decider and a recognizer and their respective language classes.
- Variants of Turing Machines (3.2)
  - Know the general idea of each variant of the Turing Machine
  - Understand the equivalence among variants of Turing Machines
- The Definition of Algorithm (3.3)
  - Understand that Turing Machines are a kind of definition for an algorithm -- that their computation power is equivalent
- Overview
  - Understand the relationship between different classes of languages
  - Understand which recognizers and generators match up with which language classes

## Some study tips

* Reread Chapters 2 and 3
* Work additional problems from textbook
* Review all notation
* Review all theorems, definitions, corollaries, lemmas
* Study lectures and notes
