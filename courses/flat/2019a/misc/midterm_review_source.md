# Midterm Review

## Topics Covered

* The midterm exam will cover Chapter 0 and Chapter 1
  - the material will especially focus on Chapter 1
  - However, Chapter 0 has foundation material from Discrete Mathematics with which you should be familiar.

## Topics Not on Exam


- You will not have problems directly related to graphs (Covered in Section 0.2)
- You will not have to *write* a proof (Section 0.4), though you should understand the theorems that have been proven in the textbook or in lecture
- You will not have to use the Pumping Lemma to prove that a language is not regular, but you should understand the general idea and what its purpose is.

        - or as a transition table,
        - or you can represent it in a state diagram

      - { w | w is has a substring of ... }
      - { w | w is has a ends with ... }
      - { w | w is has a starts with ... }
      - { w | w is is of length... }
      - { w | w is has has at most / at least / exactly X $\sigma$'s }

      - { w | w ... }
  - 1.3 Regular Expressions
    - Definition 1.52 Regular Expressions

      - Know the difference between a regular and non-regular language
