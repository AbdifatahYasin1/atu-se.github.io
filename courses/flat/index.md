## Syllabus

[Syllabus](syllabus.md)

## Textbook

* *[Introduction to the Theory of Computation -- 3rd Edition (Sipser)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X)*

## Video Lectures

* [This playlist of Shai Simonson's Lectures on Theory of Computation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL601FC994BDD963E4) will parallel much of the work in class.  Viewing will be assigned to supplement your lectures.

## Supplemental Reading

* [*Book of Proof*](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/BookOfProof.pdf)
* [*Introduction to Theory of Computation* (Maheshwari/Smid)](http://cglab.ca/~michiel/TheoryOfComputation/TheoryOfComputation.pdf)

## Definitions and Theorems

I have created a [summary page of important definitions, theorems, etc.](definitions_and_theorems.md) from our textbook for your convenience.  You should know these well.
