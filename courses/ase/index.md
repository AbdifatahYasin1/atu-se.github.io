## Assignments

*Note: most chapters will have assigned videos for viewing.  Find these in the Update section for each week.*

| Assignment | Due Date |
|------------|----------|
| 1. Create a [Github](http://github.com) account. Email link to professor | 26-Jun |
| 2. Complete [Github Hello World Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Email link to your instructor | 26-Jun |
| 3. Choose one partner and an open source [static analysis tool](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools).  Each team should choose a different tool.  You will inform your instructor of your choice on 23-Jul, and any conflicting choices will be resolved.  Download and install the static analysis tool you chose.  Study its documentation.  Download the source code of any open source project written in an language that your static analysis tool works with, and run it against the source code.  Create a 5-10 minutes presentation for the class in which you teach them about the tool and what you learned.  Then provide a 5-10 minute demonstration for the class showing the capabilities of the software and any possible vulnerabilities you identified. |  4-Aug |
