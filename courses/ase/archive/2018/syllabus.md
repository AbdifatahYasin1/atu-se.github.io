## Instructor Contact Information

Provided in Lecture

## Rationale

This course exists to build upon students' software engineering foundation, examining software engineering approaches and architectures used in large modern software engineering projects.

## Course Aims
Students shall understand the purpose, strengths and weaknesses of software re-use, component-based software engineering, distributed software engineering, embedded software, service-oriented architecture, and aspect-oriented architecture.



## Format and Procedures

### Attendance

Attendance is required and will be recorded and submitted to the department office.

### Participation

Student should attend all classes and participate in class discussion.  Outside of class, students should complete assigned reading and other assignments.  Students should follow along with the course website for supplemental instructional materials.  

##  My Assumptions

Students should have an understanding of material from the introductory Software Engineering course.  If this is a challenge, students should pursue extra remedial study to prepare them for the material in this class.  

## Course Requirements

### Required  readings
[Software Engineering, Edition 9 (Sommerville)](https://ifs.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Books/SE9/)

### Supplemental readings
Supplemental reading and other materials will be linked on the [course website](https://atu-se.github.io/courses/ase/).  Students are responsible for regularly checking the course website for updates.




## Grading Procedures

* 10% Attendance
* 40% Final
* 30% Mid-Term
* 20% Assignments: Quizzes, Homework, etc.

Late assignments will be received reduced credit at the teacher's discretion.


## Academic Integrity

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a flash drive, or a hard copy.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied may receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations may result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
