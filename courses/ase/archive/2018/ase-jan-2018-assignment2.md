# Assignment 1 - Code Reuse Memo

The fictional new start-up telecommunications company CamelComm has just decided to appoint you as the Chief Technology Officer.  Write a one-page memo to the CEO providing an overview of the reasons why you should consider using a commercial off-the-shelf system as the foundation for the backend of your new telecommunications service.  Include at least three benefits of this re-use, and include at least three risks that you will need to mitigate if you chose to re-use code in this way.
