## Team Choice Scenarios

Choose one of the scenarios below to include in your application.

### Option #1: Create an administrator login who is able to delete

You are the administrator of the RPR web application, and Asia's son keeps uploading pictures of camels to the website.  You open the web application and choose "Login".  Then, you enter a username and password.  After you have successfully entered your password, the table view shows the option to delete erroneous or fraudulent RPRs.  The "Login" button changes to "Logout".

### Option #2: Up-voting Road Problem Reports

There is a huge pile of rocks and that sits in the middle of Asia's street.  It has been there for months and she is very upset.  So far all of her efforts to have it removed have failed.  The construction crew that places it there has refused to take it, but they have also threatened that if she removed it, there would be problems.  Asia learns about the RPR web application and finds that her neighbor has already reported it.  Asia votes up the RPR for the pile of rocks, and she tells all of her neighbors to also upvote it.  Then she calls her town councilman, Abdi.
